# Online-Application (New Structure)

Good day, sir. I had to overwrite my entire branch with the new structure. I did a
``$ git push --force --set-upstream origin master ``. \
I know  this command is a bit destructive. I tried to avoid it, but I later had to use it.
I did backup the old contents of my branch before executing the command, in case there is 
need to bring back the original contents.
*** 


### Updates
* I did modify ``secretary.scala.html``. The table rows are now updating dynamically. 
* I pulled data from ``bew`` and ``antr`` tables, did the necessary comparison just like in the old source.
* I did create the relevant classes to support the secretary page.
* I have inserted all the data to their respective sections in the table.

I want to say that there are still updates to be made. I'm not sure if this is the final 
update. The lead page will still be updated. I am not yet done with my report. I plan 
to add more details to my report before the final presentation.
